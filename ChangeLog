	* worker/Makefile: reference ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.
	* worker/RSS.NET.dll: updated.
	* worker/monologue-worker.cs: don't trust RSS.NET to download the files.
	Added --cachedir option that provides a directory to keep a cache of
	downloaded files. If we have the file, send the If-Modified-Since
	header. Also allow gzipped responses.
